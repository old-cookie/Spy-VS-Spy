# Spy-VS-Spy

Fast local-network multiplayer for two players. One hosts, one joins, and both race to outplay each other with movement, items, and mini-games.

## Requirements
- Two players on the same local network
- One player acts as Host, the other as Client
- Keyboards or controllers (controls below assume keyboard)

## Setup and Lobby
1) Launch the game on both devices.
2) In the lobby, Player 1 selects **Host**.
3) Player 2 selects **Client** and connects to the host on the same network.
4) When both are connected, start the match.

## Core Controls
- `A` move left
- `D` move right
- `Space` jump
- `E` pick up item
- `Q` use held item

## Playing the Match
- Move, jump, and collect items to gain advantages.
- Use items at key moments to disrupt your opponent or secure objectives.
- Some rounds include mini-games; follow on-screen prompts to complete them.

## Quick Tips
- Stay near item spawns so you can grab them with `E` as soon as they appear.
- Time `Q` for momentum swings (interrupt jumps, deny pickups, or escape).
- Keep moving; short hops with `Space` help dodge and reposition.
- Communicate with your partner about hosting/joining to avoid connection confusion.

## Troubleshooting
- Both players must be on the same LAN; verify firewalls are not blocking the game.
- If the client cannot find the host, confirm the host started first and is visible on the network.
- Restart the lobby if either player gets desynced before the match begins.
